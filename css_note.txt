Block level element by default occupy the entire width of its parent element.

Say there are 2 block level 2 element (<aside> and <section>), and we want these to 
float side by side. We set float: left; It's not gonna work, because <aside> and <section>
are block element, so it's width by default 100%. We need to reset its width

Relative doesn't remove its element from normal document flow (but float does).

- block element can contain other block element(s) or inline element(s).
	=> Every block element always start on new line because every block element
we declare always take the full width by default
- inline element can only contain inline element(s), it can not contain block element
	=> Every inline element always start on the same line, and it's only takes 
up as much width as its content
	=> We can change inline behavior to block by set display: block/inline-block 
to inline element

===================================================

** display: block; => occupy the entire width of its parent element.
** display: inline; => ocuppy as much width as its content. You can’t set the width or height.
** display: inline-block; => It’s formatted JUST LIKE THE INLINE ELEMENT ( that is ocuppy 
as much width as its content) , where it doesn’t start on a new line. BUT, you can set 
width and height values.

=====================================================

<input type="text">
<input type="text">

input {
  width: 100%;
  display: inline-block;
}

=> display: inline-block; => doesn't work, because width is set to 100%. We need to
change the width to see the effect

.wrapper {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 500px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 1px solid red;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

=> margin: 0 auto; => doesn't work, because wrapper doesn't have margin (because it's 
displayed into "inline" element that is ocuppy as much width as its content) add "block" 
mean wrapper can set width, height



WHEN SET WIDTH AND HEIGTH, THAT WIDTH AND HEIGHT WILL APPLY TO CONTENT AREA OF THAT ELEMENT
